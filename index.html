                &nbsp;&nbsp; Ancient Indian Architecture is as old as the history of civilization in India. India's Indus Valley cities include the earliest observable evidence of architectural buildings. The most distinctive of India,s ancient architecture are its temples, Chaityas, Viharas, Stupas, and other places of worship. An empire's growth and fall, the invasion of foreign rulers who later turned native, the blending of various cultures and architectural styles, and other events are all reflected in Ancient Indian architecture.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Ancient Indian Architecture dates back to the Indian Bronze Age until about 800 CE. By the time India reached this point, Buddhism had significantly diminished, Hinduism had predominated, and religious and secular architecture styles had developed, with significant regional variations.
            </p>
            <p class="para">  
                &nbsp;&nbsp; The Indus Valley Civilization saw the emergence of its first cities during the Bronze Age. Northern Black Polished Ware and the construction of walled settlements signaled the beginning of urbanization in the Gangetic plains as early as 1200 BC.

            <p class="para">
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The use of stone in Indian architecture and the circulation of Indian currency were characteristics of the Mahajanapada era. The Mauryan era is regarded as the start of India's classical building era.

                        Carved over a period of several centuries, the mystery of Ajanta Caves might never have been uncovered had it not been for a chance pursuit of a tiger by the British Officer John Smith in the year 1819! As old as 200 BCE, the caves are located in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra. Over the multitude of years they fell into disuse and a forest grew over and around them. Carved over many many years by different artisans, they are believed to have been made a refuge for the Buddhist monks during the rains. Some go as far as to say that they were pathways to heaven.

                        With numerous carvings that describe the life and times of the eras, they are like a window that one can peek through into the glorious past of India. The caves run for a mind numbing length of 29 rock cut caves, all of which have both female and male representation, which is a rare sight! Examples of immense scientific calculations are evident too, as the sun lights up cave 19 on the winter solstice and cave 26 on the Summer solstice in a precision that has persisted over the years!

                        The landscape of Hampi in Karnataka is replete with the flows of the great Tungabhadra River and rocky outcrops that form the major part of landscape. Amongst these picturesque settings lie a group of monuments that bear a living testament to the grandeur of the last empire of India- the Vijayanagara Empire. Displaying an innate sense of Indian craftsmanship, the group of temples is flanked by chariot structures, markets and even a courtesans' walkway. Imagine the prosperity of the empire that has stables for elephants! The Vitthala Temple amongst these is the finest example of ornate architecture with gopurams, halls, sanctum sanctorium and sabha mandapas. The temple also has a market street right in the middle and a richly carved step well (Pushkarni).

                        India has had a rich and varied tradition of knowledge and learning and the standing doyenne of it is Lord Buddha. A prince who left all the worldly pleasures behind to impart peace and end the suffering of this world, Siddhartha came to do penance under a Peepul tree, a tree that would later assume the name of the Bodhi tree and the region Bodhgaya. In the sanctified town of Gaya, 96 km from Patna in Bihar, lies a holy structure that marks the path that the great ascetic took to gain divine enlightenment and where Prince Siddhartha became Buddha. The temple was first constructed by the great emperor Ashoka, in 250 BC and subsequent work was carried out by the rulers of Gupta dynasty, it is one of the earliest and pioneering examples of strong brick architecture that was to dominate the Indian building styles for years to come.

The seventh structure is the beautiful Lotus Pond, where Lord Buddha spent a whole week in atonement. More than the architecture, it is the devotion of the people that has contributed to making this stunning piece of architecture a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

On the sparkling coasts of Bay of Bengal rests this edifice that commemorates the work of the masters of ancient times. The temple has an elaborate and intricate mammoth structure that depicts the chariot of the Sun God replete with 24 carved wheels, each of them 3 m in diameter, pulled by seven horses and guarded by two lions at the entrance that bravely crush elephants.

There are also three statues of the sun god that catch the rays of the sun precisely at dawn, noon and sunset! Rabindranath Tagore has famously said about the temple “Here the language of stone surpasses the language of man.” The temple beckons to question the monotonous styles of architecture that India has regressed itself to!

                        Ask anyone, any man or woman about the icon they associate with India, and their answers would most likely allude to the Taj Mahal. Built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, it is one of the most grandiose gestures of love to ever be materialized on the face of earth. As famously said by the greatest poet, Rabindranath Tagore, “The Taj Mahal rises above the banks of the river like a solitary tear suspended on the cheek of time.” Inspite of the multitude of tourists that visit it, the declarations of love that it has witnessed and countless examples that it has set, there is a sense of melancholy as one approaches the monument, a sense of pain of a lover separated from his wife by death.

                    <p class="about">
                        The Taj Mahal was built in 1653 AD by over twenty thousand artisans who toiled over 22 years! The white marble was bought in from Makrana in Rajasthan and was transported by elephants. In its days of glory the Taj Mahal was adorned with no less than 28 types of precious stones, brought in from as far as Tibet and Persia.  Like the moods of his lady love, the exterior of the Taj also changes colors from a pinkish hue in the dawn to a dull gold at noon and finally, all enduring sparkling white under the moonlight. Legends say that as the emperor lay imprisoned by his own son in the Agra Fort, he derived solace from gazing at the tomb of his beloved wife, at whose side he was finally laid to rest.

                        The Kailasha (IAST: Kailāśa) or Kailashanatha (IAST: Kailāśanātha) temple is the largest of the rock-cut Hindu temples at the Ellora Caves, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar District, Maharashtra, India. A megalith carved from a rock cliff face, it is considered as one of the most remarkable cave temples in the world because of its size, architecture and sculptural treatment, and "the climax of the rock-cut phase of Indian architecture". The top of the superstructure over the sanctuary is 32.6 metres (107 ft) above the level of the court below, although the rock face slopes downwards from the rear of the temple to the front. Archaeologists believe it is made from a single rock.

                        The Kailasa temple is the largest of the 34 Hindu, Buddhist and Jain cave temples and monasteries known collectively as the Ellora Caves, ranging for over two kilometres (1.2 mi) along the sloping basalt cliff at the site. Most of the excavation of the temple is generally attributed to the eighth century Rashtrakuta king Krishna I, with some elements completed later. The temple architecture shows traces of Pallava and Chalukya styles. The temple contains a number of relief and free-standing sculptures on a grand scale equal to the architecture, though only traces remain of the paintings which originally decorated it.

                        The beautiful Chola temples are living tales of the vast empire that Cholas established in Thanjavur. These magnificent temples built during the reign of Rajaraja were the epitome of the vast religious inclination of these rulers as the inscriptions and the chronicles on the wall sing about their opulent rule. This temple in the ancient time was note a mere religious center but a full functional business establishment which was served and maintained by a permanent staff of several hundred priests, 400 devadasi and 57 musicians.

The entire temple carved in granite is believed to be inspired by the Pallava architecture. The beautifully adorned 108 poses of the Bharata- Natyam on the walls reflects the hours of torturous patience the sculptures went through. The beautiful series of carvings depicting the legend ruler Rajaraja conversing with his guru, Karuvir Devar is stunningly sculpted in rich colors which rewinds you to the beautiful ancient time of king and queens.

                        Nalanda (Nālandā, pronounced was a renowned mahavihara (Buddhist monastic university) in ancient Magadha (modern-day Bihar), India. Considered by historians to be the world's first residential university and among the greatest centers of learning in the ancient world, it was located near the city of Rajagriha (now Rajgir) and about 90 kilometres (56 mi) southeast of Pataliputra (now Patna). Operating from 427 until 1197 CE, Nalanda played a vital role in promoting the patronage of arts and academics during the 5th and 6th century CE, a period that has since been described as the "Golden Age of India" by scholars. Before it was destroyed and burned much of its facilities at the beginning of the twelfth century by the Islamic invader Bakhtiyar Khilj, Nalanda held over 9 million texts.

                    <p class="about">
                        Nalanda was established during the Gupta Empire era, and was supported by numerous Indian and Javanese patrons both Buddhists and non-Buddhists. Over some 750 years, its faculty included some of the most revered scholars of Mahayana Buddhism. Nalanda mahavihara taught six major Buddhist schools and philosophies such as Yogachara and Sarvastivada as well as subjects such as grammar, medicine, logic and mathematics. The university was also a major source of the 657 Sanskrit texts carried by pilgrim Xuanzang and the 400 Sanskrit texts carried by Yijing to China in the 7th century, which influenced East Asian Buddhism. Many of the texts composed at Nalanda played an important role in the development of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism including the Mahavairocana Tantra and the Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra of Shantideva. It was sacked and destroyed by the troops of Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji, partly restored thereafter, and continued to exist till about 1400 CE. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The name of the city of 'Thiruvananthapuram' in Malayalam and Tamil translates to "The City of Lord Ananta" (Ananta being a form of Vishnu). The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the Chera style and the Dravidian style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopura. While as per some traditions the Ananthapura temple in Kumbla in Kasaragod district in Kerala is considered as the original spiritual seat of the deity ("Moolasthanam"), architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar in Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu.

Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of the Travancore royal family. The titular Maharaja of Travancore, Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma, is the current trustee of the temple.

But, there was one tomb before that, that a grieving widow built for the love and devotion that she felt towards her husband; The Humayun Tomb. The pioneering example of Mughal architecture, its glorious combination of Persian and Indian architecture forms was to set a prelude to an era that was to be embellished by the grandeur of Mughal architecture. Bega Begum, spent her entire life overseeing the construction and design of this tomb that was commissioned to the great Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyas.

Despite being the first standardized example of this style, Humayun's Tomb is an architectural achievement of the highest order.”
